                    This study investigates the spatiotemporal changes in the usage of the subway, taxi, and bike in New
                    York City before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis covers a period between 2019 and
                    2022, aiming to identify differences in usage patterns and emerging trends in response to the
                    pandemic. By utilizing geospatial techniques such as OD map, hex-grid map, heatmap, and hot spot
                    analysis, this study reveals that bike travel is more resilient than subway and taxi travel,
                    exhibiting a stable trend during the pandemic and quick recovery in the post-pandemic context,
                    despite its lower overall volume compared to the other two transport modes. Furthermore, the study
                    highlights the significance of the mono-centric urban structure in shaping urban mobility patterns,
                    where the urban center is a hub of high-travel hot spots that are fragile in sustaining trip volumes
                    during the pandemic. The findings of this research could offer valuable insights for policymakers
                    and transportation planners to enhance the resilience and sustainability of urban transportation
                    systems. Additionally, the integration of web maps could provide an interactive and intuitive
                    visualization tool for supporting urban planning decision-making.

                  <p>Urban mobility plays a vital role in the functioning of cities, and understanding the
                    spatiotemporal patterns of transportation usage is crucial for policymakers and urban planners. The
                    COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on people's lives, including their transportation
                    habits. In this study, we examine the spatiotemporal changes in the subway, taxi, and bike usage
                    data in New York City before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We selected these modes of
                    transportation for the following three reasons:
                    They represent different types of transportation — namely, public transportation, vehicular
                    transportation, and active transportation
                    Their data are publicly available
                    They are the major choices of transportation for many people in the city (Shill, 2022).

                    The impacts of COVID-19 on urban mobility, particularly on subway, taxi, and bike usage in New York
                    City (NYC), have been the subject of several studies. For example, there have been studies on subway
                    ridership change during COVID-19. Wang and Noland (2021) analyzed the NYC subway ridership from 2019
                    to 2020 and found that subway ridership was negatively affected by the pandemic, and it remained low
                    in late 2020. Other studies also confirm this trend (Halvorsen et al., 2021; Sy et al., 2021). As
                    for taxi ridership, Li et al. (2022) reported that taxi usage also declined after the outbreak of
                    COVID-19. Additionally, Manley et al. (2021) found that there was a shift in payment style for
                    taxis. In terms of bike usage, Teixeira and Lopes (2020) found that it decreased initially during
                    the outbreak. However, a study by Bi et al. (2022) and Wang and Noland (2021) revealed that bike
                    usage had returned to normal after about a year, with some spatial heterogeneity driven by different
                    points of interest.

                    Despite the wealth of research on the topic, there are still research gaps that need to be
                    addressed. Specifically, no study has followed up on the trend of subway, taxi, and bike usage after
                    COVID-19 calmed down (i.e., data after the second half of 2022). Furthermore, no study has compared
                    the trend of subway, taxi, and bike usage in New York City before and after COVID-19. This
                    literature review highlights the need for further research to fill these research gaps and provide a
                    more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 on urban mobility in New York City.
                    Therefore, by analyzing data collected between 2019 and 2022, we aim to identify differences in
                    usage patterns and any trends that may have emerged as a result of the pandemic.

                    To accomplish the research objectives, this study will comprehensively examine the following three
                    questions:
                    What is the evolutionary pattern of urban flow in New York City during and after the COVID-19
                    pandemic?
                    Does the utilization of shared bikes exhibit greater resilience compared to taxi and subway travel
                    modes?
                    What are the spatial distribution patterns and transformations observed among distinct
                    transportation modes?

                  <h3>2.1 Study area data</h3>
                  <p>The study is conducted within the geographic scope of New York City, encompassing a total of 71
                    community districts, 472 subway stations, and 61,823 Citi Bike stations (Fig. 1). The geographic
                    boundaries of the community districts and station locations are obtained from the NYC OpenData
                    (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Shapefiles-and-base-map/2k7f-6s2k). </p>
                  <h3>2.2 Transportation data</h3>
                  <p>This project utilizes three primary sources of data for its analysis: the NYC Metropolitan
                    Transportation Authority’s subway turnstile data, Taxi & Limousine Commission's data, and Citi
                    Bike's historical data. The NYC Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s subway turnstile data covers
                    the period from January 2019 to March 2023 and includes attributes such as device ID and accumulated
                    counts.
                    The Taxi & Limousine Commission data covers the period from January 2019 to December 2022, and it
                    includes usage data such as start and end times and taxi zone IDs, as well as taxi zone data
                    including zone IDs, longitude, and latitude.
                    The Citi Bike data covers the period from January 2019 to March 2023 and includes attributes such as
                    start and end times, longitude, and latitude for each ride. This data covers most of New York City
                    and is a great source to study the patterns of bike usage in the city.
                    For those interested in exploring the data further, we have included URLs for both data sources in
                    the bullet points below:

                  <h3>3.1 Data acquisition</h3>
                  <p>For the subway data, there is a Python package called pymtattl
                    (https://github.com/Ritaotao/pymtattl) to automate the downloading of the text files that contain
                    the data of the entry and exit by device and timestamp. This package scrapes the websites to
                    retrieve the URL of the files and then downloads them to a local disk.

                    As for the taxi and bike data, the methodology for downloading the data involves using R code to
                    download the data from a specified URL and save it in a local directory. First, the code sets the
                    necessary options for downloading the data, including the output directory and URL for the data. It
                    sets the start and end dates for the data and creates a sequence of months between them. The code
                    also defines a list of data types to download. Then, it loops through the data types and months to
                    download and save the data. It formats the URL for each month and data type and sets the destination
                    file name for each download.
                  </p>
                  <h3>3.2 Data cleaning</h3>
                  <p>
                    Cleaning of the subway data can also be done using pymtattl, which takes the differences of
                    accumulated counts for each device by timestamp and stores them in a SQL database. After this
                    processing, we aggregated the number of entries and exits by year-month combination and station
                    locations.

                    For taxi and bike data, the data cleaning methodology is slightly more complex and involves reading
                    data from multiple CSV files and combining them into one data frame, cleaning and selecting certain
                    columns, and joining the data with a shapefile of New York City neighborhood boundaries. It then
                    extracts the coordinates of the neighborhood centroids and combines them with the station locations
                    to create a dataset with station locations and the corresponding neighborhood.

                    The basic workflow is as follows. Data from multiple CSV files are read in and cleaned by selecting
                    certain columns and rounding the "started_at" and "ended_at" columns to the nearest hour. The
                    cleaned data is combined into one data frame and written into a CSV file. The code then reads the
                    CSV file and cleans the column names. A unique set of station IDs and locations is created by
                    combining the start and end station IDs and latitudes and longitudes. This dataset is joined with
                    the neighborhood shapefile, and the coordinates of the neighborhood centroids are extracted. The
                    coordinates are combined with the station locations to create a dataset with station locations and
                    the corresponding neighborhood.

                    For the origin-destination (OD) map, we grouped the data by year-month combination, start location,
                    and end location to get the count of bikes and taxis. And for the hexagon grid maps, we grouped by
                    start time year-month combination and end time year-month combination, and end locations.

                    By running spatial join, the count data were further aggregated to the neighborhood tabulation area
                    for bike data to reduce the computation burden as well as to the taxi zone area for taxi data.
                  </p>
                  <h3>3.3 GIS analysis and visualization methods</h3>
                  <p>We have employed Kepler.gl software (https://kepler.gl/) to visualize the overall travel trends of
                    Citi Bike and Taxi. Kepler.gl offers a convenient workflow to display OD lines and enables filtering
                    with timestamps, which facilitates the production of monthly-changing travel patterns. Based on the
                    evolutionary results, line charts are created to demonstrate overall mobility trends and monthly
                    trips of the three transportation modes.

                    To further illustrate the detailed evolution of travel patterns, we have utilized hex-grid maps and
                    heat maps. Hex-grid maps were created in ArcGIS Pro by aggregating the counts of start and end
                    points for Citi Bike, taxi, and subway transportation modes, grouped by month. Each hex-grid map
                    contains three dimensions of information, namely location, travel volume, and timestamps. The
                    hex-grid map was then visualized using the Instant App feature in ArcGIS online to capture
                    spatiotemporal mobility patterns. Additionally, we created heatmaps containing each hex-grid ID,
                    date, and count using Python for static comparative analysis.

                    To demonstrate the spatial clustering feature of travel patterns, we employed hot spot analysis.
                    This technique is also known as spatial clustering analysis, which identifies areas with significant
                    clusters of high or low values in a given dataset. The analysis relies on statistical measures such
                    as the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, which detects clusters of statistically significant high or low
                    values in the dataset. In this study, the hot spot analysis is applied to identify agglomeration
                    areas with a high frequency of travel behavior and to investigate the spatial distribution pattern
                    of travel demand during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The evolution of hot spot areas is
                    visualized using the Dashboard tool in ArcGIS online.

                  <h3>4.1 Evolutionary pattern of urban flows</h3>
                  <p>Figure 3 displays the temporal evolution of the overall mobility patterns of Citi Bike, taxi, and
                    subway from January 2019 to December 2022. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the monthly trip count
                    was approximately 120 million and 30 million for subway and taxi transportation, respectively. Citi
                    Bike trip fluctuated in response to environmental factors, with a monthly flow of approximately 2.5
                    million in summer and 1 million in winter.

                    On March 12th, 2020, the city of New York declared a state of emergency in response to the COVID-19
                    outbreak, followed by a stay-at-home order on March 20th, 2020. During this period, the trip counts
                    of all three transportation modes declined sharply, with subway and taxi trip reductions being more
                    pronounced than Citi Bike. From June to August 2020, a three-phase reopening policy was gradually
                    enacted, resulting in a rebound in trip demand. However, the total number of subway and taxi trips
                    never returned to pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, Citi Bike trips recovered quickly and gradually
                    increased in the post-pandemic years. Nevertheless, the bike flow was significantly influenced by
                    weather conditions.

                    Figure 4 presents a year-on-year comparison and expresses the recovery rate to be 30% and 60% for
                    subway and taxi trips, respectively. Furthermore, an increasing number of individuals have chosen to
                    commute by bike following the COVID-19 outbreak, though the total trip count for this mode of
                    transportation remains lower than that for subway and taxi trips.

                  <p>The spatio-temporal analysis of trip count is further visualized in an Instant App created using
                    ArcGIS Online (Map 1). This App provides dynamic displays of the monthly trip counts in the three
                    transport modes, with start and end points included to provide insights into the location and timing
                    of travel behavior.</p>

                  <p>To facilitate the representation of spatiotemporal patterns on a two-dimensional medium, we
                    employed a heatmap (Fig. 5) to display all hex grids with individual trip counts from 2019 to 2022.
                    Each grid's value is standardized, with redder grids indicating higher trip counts. An obvious
                    light-colored strip in the three transportation modes began in April 2020, with wider strips
                    observed in taxi and subway trips, indicating a longer recovery time than for bike trips. Moreover,
                    the color of grid units after the COVID-19 outbreak is lighter than before the pandemic, suggesting
                    a decline in trip counts overall. However, the bike trip demand recovered quickly and continued to
                    increase in the following years.

                    The heatmap also reveals spatial transport patterns, with most dark red units located at the bottom
                    corresponding to Manhattan, the center of New York City. This finding indicates higher urban
                    vitality in the city center of this mono-centric city. Furthermore, two dark red strips are located
                    in the upper area of the taxi heatmap, representing the John F. Kennedy International Airport and
                    the Newark Liberty International Airport. Additionally, taxi trips in peripheral urban areas exhibit
                    more resilience than those in urban core areas.

                  <h3>4.3 Spatial distribution patterns</h3>
                  <p>The utilization of hot spot analysis in this study serves to highlight the spatial clustering
                    characteristics of travel behavior, whereby significant clusters of high or low trip values are
                    identified. The results of the Citi Bike analysis reveal the robustness of bike trips in terms of
                    year-on-year and month-on-month comparisons, with stable trip volumes observed in the urban core
                    both before and after the pandemic. The identification of cold spots in North Manhattan is
                    attributed to the expansion of new bike service stations during the recovery period, which has
                    served to encourage bike travel in this area.

                    The spatial clusters of taxi trip evolution exhibit an intriguing pattern, with a significant
                    decrease in demand observed in the city center during the pandemic. This led to a shift in hot spots
                    from Manhattan to peripheral areas, such as Brooklyn and North Manhattan, from April to June 2020.
                    However, post-pandemic in 2021, hot spots returned to Manhattan, indicating a highly concentrated
                    travel pattern in this area. The identification of consistent cold spots in Queens, a wealthy area
                    in New York City, is also noteworthy.

                    Similarly, the spatial pattern of subway travel demonstrates a decline in overall travel demand
                    during the pandemic. However, the presence of necessary work commutes generated hot spots in the
                    urban core. The reconcentration of hot spots in the urban core from 2021 reflects a trend similar to
                    that observed in taxi travel. Overall, the application of hot spot analysis effectively visualizes
                    the spatial clustering of travel behavior in New York City, providing insights into the evolution of
                    travel patterns during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    The hot spot analysis combined with the line chart in Section 4.1 is visualized in an interactive
                    dashboard in ArcGIS Online (Map 2).

                  <h3>4.4 Discussion</h3>
                  <p>This study sheds light on the evolution of travel patterns before and after the COVID-19 pandemic
                    by investigating three modes of transportation: Citi Bike, taxi, and subway over a long time period
                    from January 2019 to December 2022. The findings suggest that Citi Bike trips exhibit greater
                    resilience compared to taxi and subway travel, although the total number of bike trips is still
                    smaller than the other two modes. This can be attributed to the limited distance covered by bike
                    trips and their dependence on weather conditions. Specifically, the trip volume is higher in warm
                    seasons and lower in cold months.

                    The hot spot analysis conducted in this study not only demonstrates significant spatial clusters of
                    travel concentrations but also reveals the urban spatial structure of New York City as a
                    mono-centric city that agglomerates capital, and vital urban life and provides work opportunities in
                    the Manhattan area. However, this urban structure is shown to be fragile during the pandemic and
                    recovers slowly in the post-pandemic period. The spatiotemporal analysis presented in this study,
                    through the two web maps, can provide evidence to support poly-centric and public transport priority
                    urban planning.

                    <p>In conclusion, this research makes a contribution to the understanding of travel behavior in the
                      context of the COVID-19 pandemic by examining the spatiotemporal patterns of three modes of
                      transportation. The study highlights the resilience of bike travel compared to taxi and subway
                      travel, and the importance of the mono-centric urban structure of New York City in shaping travel
                      behavior. The findings have practical implications for policymakers and transportation planners,
                      as they can inform decision-making on transportation planning and infrastructure development to
                      enhance the resilience and sustainability of urban transportation systems.

                      This study also employs innovative approaches by combining analysis and visualization to provide
                      more interactive and accessible insights into mobility data. Furthermore, the research covers a
                      longer time interval than most previous studies and comparatively investigates how the pandemic
                      has influenced people's travel behavior. However, further studies are needed to explore the
                      underlying reasons for the observed patterns with a more detailed and high-resolution time
                      division, such as daily travel patterns.
